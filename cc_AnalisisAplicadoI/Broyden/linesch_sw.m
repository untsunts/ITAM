%          linesch_sw(x0, f0, grad0, d, pars, c1, c2, prtlevel);
%  written by M. Overton (overton@cs.nyu.edu)
%  input
%   x0:      intial point
%   f0:      function value at x0
%   g0:      gradient at x0
%   d:       search direction (called p in Nocedal and Wright's book) 
%   fgname:  name of function that returns function and gradient
%            it expects as input only x and pars, a parameter structure 
%            it is invoked by: [f,g] = feval(fgname, x, pars)
%   c1: Wolfe parameter for the condition 
%          f(x0 + alpha d) < = f0 + c1*alpha*grad0'*d   (default 0)
%        in theory, should be positive, but 0 works fine in practice
%   c2: Wolfe parameter for the (strong) condition 
%          abs((grad f)(x0 + alpha d)'*d) < = -c2*grad0'*d
%        these should satisfy 0 <= c1 <= c2 <= 1     (default 0.5)
%        usually, c1 should be small but c2 should not, but set c2 small
%         if an accurate line search is desired
%        for BFGS, only need c2 < 1 for update to be positive definite 
%        for nonlinear conjugate gradient, need c2 < 0.5 for the 
%         Fletcher-Reeves convergence analysis to apply
%   prtlevel: 2 for info when line search fails (default), 0 for no printing
%      
%  output:
%   alpha: steplength satisfying Wolfe conditions
%   x:     x0 + alpha*d
%   f:     f(x0 + alpha d)
%   grad:  (grad f)(x0 + alpha d)
%   fail:  0 for normal termination (Wolfe conditions satisfied)
%          1 if too many steps were taken in lszoom (Wolfe conds not satisfied)
%          -1 if minimizer was not bracketed (too many expansion steps, 
%                                              function may be unbounded below)
%   nsteps: number of steps taken in lszoom
